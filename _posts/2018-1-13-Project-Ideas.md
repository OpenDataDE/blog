title: Project ideas for Open Data Delaware
---
Are you new to Open Data Delaware, or maybe a long-time contributor looking for something to work on? Here are some ideas:


## From the state's [Open Data Portal](https://data.delaware.gov/browse):

### Professional Licensing
Relevant datasets:
1. [Professional and Occupational Licensing](https://data.delaware.gov/Licenses-and-Certifications/Professional-and-Occupational-Licensing/pjnv-eaih)
2. [Disciplinary Actions for Professional and Occupational Licensees](https://data.delaware.gov/Licenses-and-Certifications/Disciplinary-Actions-for-Professional-and-Occupati/dz6p-akeq)

* What are the most common fines? Who recieved the most disciplinary actions?
* Which professions have received the most disciplinary actions? What types of disciplinary actions are those? Are there any trends that you notice?
* Can disciplinary actions by professional license type by normalized (for example, _percent_ of nurses in the state as opposed to _raw number_ of nurses)?
* Can you build system to allow a member of the public to look up a person with a profesionnal license and see their history?
* Where are most professional licenses located? Has this changed over time? Can you normalize this by population of the cities where professional licenses are located?

### Education
Relevant datasets:
1. [Student Performance](https://data.delaware.gov/Education/Student-Performance/a7g2-pjpe)
2. [School Directory](https://data.delaware.gov/Education/School-Directory/wky5-77bt)

* From 2012 - 2015 (years data is available), which school districts had the largest increase in test scores?
* Which schools are closest to facilities in the [Toxics Release Inventory](https://data.delaware.gov/Energy-and-Environment/Toxics-Release-Inventory/9bws-2xkb)?


## Not Delaware, but fun

* Find a bunch of recipes for chocolate cookies and average them out. We got this idea from [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/).
