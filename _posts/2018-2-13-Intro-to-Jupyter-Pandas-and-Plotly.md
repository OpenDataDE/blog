title: Project ideas for Open Data Delaware
---
Are you new to Open Data Delaware, or maybe a long-time contributor looking for something to work on? Here are some ideas:


## From the state's [Open Data Portal](https://data.delaware.gov/browse):
* What are the most common fines from the [Disciplinary Actions for Professional and Occupational Licensees](https://data.delaware.gov/Licenses-and-Certifications/Disciplinary-Actions-for-Professional-and-Occupati/dz6p-akeq)? Who recieved the most disciplinary actions? 
* From 2012 - 2015 (years data is available), which school districts had the largest increase in test scores? [Student Performance](https://data.delaware.gov/Education/Student-Performance/a7g2-pjpe) / [School Directory](https://data.delaware.gov/Education/School-Directory/wky5-77bt)
* Which schools are closest to facilities in the [Toxics Release Inventory](https://data.delaware.gov/Energy-and-Environment/Toxics-Release-Inventory/9bws-2xkb)? Helpful: [School Directory](https://data.delaware.gov/Education/School-Directory/wky5-77bt)


## Not Delaware, but fun

* Find a bunch of recipes for chocolate cookies and average them out. We got this idea from [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/).
